# gnss_insar_ts
This python script takes as input a .tenv3 three component GNSS file as downloaded from Nevada Geodetic GPS Portal. The three component displacements are converted into LoS direction to compare to LoS displacements calculated using Sentinel-1 InSAR.
Linear fits to GNSS and InSAR data are calculated and plotted.
