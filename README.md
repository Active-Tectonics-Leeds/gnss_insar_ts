# gnss_insar_ts
This python script takes a .tenv3 three component GNSS file as downloaded from Nevada Geodetic GPS Portal and converts the three components into LoS direction to compare to LoS displacments calculated using Sentinel-1 InSAR.
Linear fits to GNSS and InSAR data are calculated and plotted.
